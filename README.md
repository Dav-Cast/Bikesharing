## Overview
In this project a deep analysis on real bike-sharing data will be run, as to get concrete conclusions and key findings to apply in a similar project. These findings will be developed and presented with help of Tableau.

## Results

### Locations
From the data we got different types of visualizations to help us prove points or help gather more inforamtion as to study how the behavior of the clients is. In the first visualization a summary of the starting and ending locations is showed, not only the numbers are present but the location and a color key was added as to make it easy to understand at glance. Also the total amount of trips is added as to complement the location information. In this visualization th top locations can be obtained if needed or the bottom locations as well. The key information we can obtain from this tool would be to study why the top starting location is the top (maybe the area is more secure or people prefer to use them to go to work) and also to be more prepared in terms of bike quantities, the same can be said for the top ending locations as this is where the most stations should be and where the most used bikes should be (for maintenance consideration).

### Checkout times
Next the checkout times of the trips is graphed by total and divided by gender, the information allows to see the quantity of bikes that took long or short trips overall. The gender allows us to study with more detail what our market is and also an area of opportunity to grow. With help of Tableau we are able to filter our data and either show the longest or shortest rides at fast speed. From these we can conclude that men are the users that most use the service by a big difference, so as an area of growth the service should be pushed for females, also we can see that most of the bikes are used for quick trips rather than large ones so a regular and comfortable bike should be enough rather than a high-end bike.

### Trips per Weekday
Next the trips per weekday show the amount of trips and divide it by weekday and also by hour, two other complementing visualizations were added, one that divides the information even more, this time by gender, the second visualization instead of showing the hour it divides by type of customer instead. Having all three visualizations helps to find key findings faster and makes it easier to take decisions. They may seem to have the same information but actually they show more insights that otherwise would be more difficult to notice. The key findings in these visualizations are that during working days the busiest hours are early in the morning (6-10 am) and late in the afternoon (5-9 pm) while during the weekends is during the afternoon (9 am - 7 pm) so we conclude that people use them not only to go to work but for other purposes, another finding is the confirmation of men being the gender that most use the service and finally that the user type that most use the service fy far are subscribers so it should be for the best to sell more subscriptions.

### Possible Bike Repairs
The next visualixation is a heat map that shows the quantity of times a single bike was used, it is easier to understand by size and color. From this tool we can conclude which how the trips distribution works and also come up with strategies to spread it evenly, like for example rotate by location the bikes or maybe give maintenance to the top 100 most used bikes by month as to avoid future complications.

## Summary
As demonstrated in the last section the tools Tableau brings are more than enough to convey a great analysis, develop ideas, find insights or show conclutions in a more appealing and easy to understand way. To have the ability to graph locations are great to understand the user behaviour, to see the quantities of bikes used for less than an hour also brings a deeper understanding to the use the users give to the bike, to be able to see the busiest hours during the day by week also allows to make decisions as to when the bikes are needed, finally the usage of the bikes permits to act fast to bring maintenance to certain bikes and also shows the spread of the trips between all the bikes. Each visualization helped convey a better conclution on the information gathered and hopefully understand better the service as to try to replicate it or at least be on the lookout on the key findings. Even though this resumes most of the info two other visualizations should be explored as well: the total amount of time usage by user age as to get an idea of the type of people that use the service and the locations by trip amount and divided by user type as to get an idea if the location has to do with the type of user.
