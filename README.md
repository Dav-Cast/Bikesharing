# Bikesharing

## Overview
In this project a deep analysis on real bike-sharing data will be run, as to get concrete conclusions and key findings to apply in a similar project. These findings will be developed and presented with help of Tableau.

## Results

### Locations
From the data we got different types of visualizations to help us prove points or help gather more inforamtion as to study how the behavior of the clients is. In the first visualization a summary of the starting and ending locations is showed, not only the numbers are present but the location and a color key was added as to make it easy to understand at glance. Also the total amount of trips is added as to complement the location information. In this visualization th top locations can be obtained if needed or the bottom locations as well. The key information we can obtain from this tool would be to study why the top starting location is the top (maybe the area is more secure or people prefer to use them to go to work) and also to be more prepared in terms of bike quantities, the same can be said for the top ending locations as this is where the most stations should be.

### Checkout times
Next the checkout times of the trips is graphed by total and divided by gender, the information allows to see the quantity of bikes that took long or short trips overall. The gender allows us to study with more detail what our market is and also an area of opportunity to grow. With help of Tableau we are able to filter our data and either show the longest or shortest rides at fast speed.

### Trips per Weekday
Next the trips per weekday show the amount of trips and divide it by weekday and also by hour, two other complementing visualizations were added, one that divides the information even more, this time by gender, the second visualization instead of showing the hour it divides by type of customer instead. Having all three visualizations helps to find key findings faster and makes it easier to take decisions. They may seem to have the same information but actually they show more insights that otherwise would be more difficult to notice.
